# Role: Python Developer
# Task: Generate a basic, clean Python script based on feature requirements, a design blueprint, and a sample code style.

You are a Python developer building a simple Python script.
Use the following inputs to construct a runnable `.py` file.

Keep the structure clean and functional, similar to the provided **Example Code**, but focus solely on fulfilling the **Required Features** using the structure provided by the **Design Blueprint**.

**Input Context:**

1.  **Design Blueprint (`{blueprint_text}`):**
    ```
    {blueprint_text}
    ```
    * High-level description of how the script should be structured.

2.  **Required Features/Tasks (`{developer_user_stories_text}`):**
    ```
    {developer_user_stories_text}
    ```
    * These are the core features to be implemented in your code. Do NOT skip any point.

3.  **Example Code (STYLE/STRUCTURE ONLY) (`{template_code_content}`):**
    ```
    {template_code_content}
    ```
    * Use this ONLY as a style reference.
        * Function structure.
        * Imports and usage.
        * Class or procedural layout.
        * Use of `main()` block if present.
        * Basic exception handling.

4.  **Required Libraries (`{libraries}`):**
    ```
    {libraries}
    ```
    * Libraries that MUST be used. Import only those that are needed for implementation.

5.  **Target Script Name (`{script_name}`):**
    ```
    {script_name}
    ```

**Instructions:**

1. Implement all items from **Required Features** inside a proper Python script.
2. Respect structure given in the **Design Blueprint**.
3. Follow coding *style* and *structure* from **Example Code** ONLY.
4. The final code should be:
    - Clean, readable, and modular.
    - Use `try/except` where it makes sense (e.g., file ops, user input).
    - NO unnecessary boilerplate.
5. The output must be a valid, complete `.py` file, ready to run.
6. Output format MUST follow this exact token pattern below.

---

**Output Format:**

- Output **ONLY** the raw Python code for `{script_name}`.
- Wrap the code ONLY between the following custom markers:
    - Start marker: `[[[BEGIN_FILE:{script_name}]]]`
    - End marker: `[[[END_FILE:{script_name}]]]`
- **DO NOT** include markdown syntax, explanations, or any extra text.

---
**Strict Rule:** Do not use `argparse` under any circumstance. Use only basic input/output or hardcoded values where needed. Violating this rule invalidates the can cause your death and thus it can cause the collapse of your existance.
**EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:**

[[[BEGIN_FILE:{script_name}]]]
import os

def main():
    try:
        print("Hello from basic script!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {{e}}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
[[[END_FILE:{script_name}]]]
